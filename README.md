# Simon-Game
The Simon Game is a simple yet engaging memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to repeat the sequence of colors shown by the game. With each correct attempt, the sequence becomes longer, making the challenge more exciting. Itâ€™s a fun mini-project to improve logical thinking and practice JavaScript.
